Encoding Preference

There are large performance differences between different encoding types.
Will show a table of different encoding types.

- BINARY pre v0.11 was done custom in Node converting each byte into a
  uint8_t. This was very slow.
- v8 has new OneByte API used in v0.11 that basically streams the data in
  binary format. Extremely fast.
- BINARY encoding is basically LATIN1.

There are some cool tricks we can use to represent UTF8 data in a binary
format to get around encoding/decoding performance. This can be useful
when performing basic operations on JSON data. Working with JSON data in
a Buffer is something that I wouldn't even want to do.

New v8 has a JSON C++ API (need to test and see the conversion times on
the Buffers).

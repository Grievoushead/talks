Shared Objects

When you can set a callback or object, and you know it won't change, then
it's easy to Persist the item in C++. Though when the properties can change
then you'd usually need to read the item as a String.

But, there's an alternative. By creating a numberically index Object and
Persisting that in C++, it's easy to change the Object properties and
access the needed information more quickly.

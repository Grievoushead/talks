Large Strings

Copying data into the v8 heap can usually be inexpensive, but there is a
wall where the GC will spin up and take forever to process. To get around
this Externalized Strings have been implemented. Unfortunately they are
only allowed for specific string types. This will discuss the difference
between encodings, and how to best take advantage of these.

This test only works with a custom build of Node that disables the use of
externalized strings in string_bytes.

Also, throw in some small example of creating mutable strings.

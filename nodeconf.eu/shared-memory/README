Shared Memory State

In JS it's common practice to flow logic based on what Object properties
have been set. Checking Object properties from C++ can kill your app, so
instead it's useful to create a stateful Object that's passed to C++ and
place external memory on that Object. Then within C++ create a struct
around the data. This way we can easily read/write to these flags and
get around the cost of needing to check the Object's properties.

The main place this is used is process.nextTick, to communicate with
MakeCallback about the current state of having callback in the queue.
